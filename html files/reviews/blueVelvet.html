                        The last scene in Blue Velvet is the perfect wrap up for what I had just laid my eyes on the previous 120 minutes. 
                        In one of Lynch’s easiest to follow films, a contagious feeling of wonder is passed from the main protagonist to the viewer.

                        Suburbia… a place where nothing bad ever happens. The small chance something out of the ordinary occurs, no need to worry! 
                        It will be covered up by smiles, robins, and lunch time. As Lynch moves back and forth from this “paradise” to a sickening alternative, 
                        it is important to keep in mind these two environments are actually in the same place. Jeffery (Kyle MacLachlan) and Sandy (Laura Dern) 
                        tag team this mystery following a singer named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) that becomes more and more repulsing, until it's not.

                        Jeffery’s curiosity (or perversion) gains him the knowledge of what messed up situation is occurring between Dorothy and a man named Frank. 
                        While horrible, I was just waiting for things to get weirder. That happened once Frank met Jeffery face to face. Awkward parties, lip synching cues 
                        resulting in tears, and dancing on top of cars while getting lipstick smeared on your face. Jeffery is such an interesting character… I can’t tell if 
                        he is just a curious young man who is back home from college, or a giant pervert just waiting for some fantasy to come true. We can all agree that Frank is 
                        a horrible person in this movie… but Lynch does such a good job at making it still so easy to laugh at him. The actions of Frank are down right horrendous, 
                        but this character is what also makes this movie so much fun. So it is quite an interesting contrast. A fun fact about Frank is how much he enjoys PBR beer, 
                        he's not really one for Heineken.

                        The contrast of surface level suburbia and the true dark realities, bring out interesting differences in performances. Isabella Rossellini's character does not seem 
                        to fit in any predetermined role as far as stereotypical character arcs or story structures go unlike some of the other characters. This seems like a very straining and
                         difficult character to play, especially compared to the lighter load of the others. But after I read some things that Rossellini said during / after filming, it seems she
                          actually had a fun time. Dean Stockwell’s performance as Ben really had some fire behind it. His presence was small and timid in a way you could think that he wouldn’t hurt
                           a fly. But the way Frank seems to be under him in some hierarchy makes you assume this man is evil. His performance to “In Dreams” is a quick reminder who is directing this movie,
                            just in case you forgot.

                        Cookie cutter protagonists… check. Uninvolved and incapable young man must save women in extremely heavy situation… check. Messy love interests throughout the film ending with the perfect match… check. Young man ends up saving the day…check. Everything is back to normal and this will never be spoken about again… check. Through all the cliques and suburbia-esque story structures,the cheesy dialogue did catch me off guard every now and then. Was that all part of the point, maybe, and if so I guess that's okay. And if it wasn't that's okay, not all movies need good dialogue.
